This project is a part of Ironhack Data Analytics Full Time Bootcamp course.
# 1. Project Description
Wine has an old history. Many civilizations produced wine and fermanted beverages. Cultures, religions, many society put values on wine. In our modern world, wine tasting and becoming a wine enthusiastic is a long progress.

In my project its been used different two datasets. 

One is from wine enthusiasts https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews which contains 130k wine reviews with variety, location, winery, price, and description

Second is red and white wine quality measurements. The dataset is from https://www.kaggle.com/rajyellow46/wine-quality
# 2. My Motivation
To be able to progress my story-telling skills, I wanted to share my project with my colleagues for finding the finest wine for their budget and for their pleasure.

After finding the suitable wine, to detect what makes that wine good, i shared my ML to detect good quality wine.
# 3. Tools that I used
The main technologies used here are Python and Tableau Public. The raw data file has been imported and wrangled in Jupyter notebook using Pandas, clean .csv files exported & imported & joined in Tableau for visualizations.

For the answers that my colleagues required i used my dataset in MySQL as well. Some parts I imported to my Jupyter Notebook as well.

# 4. Challenges
For the wine review dataset, dealing with a lot of unique values for my modeling by categorizing them. I chose the best 12 countries by their exporting rates on my model.

For those who would like to use the dataset, it is pretty useful for the EDA purposes and graphic explanations.

Being aware of the dublicated rows is significant. Especially you would like to present your work on Tableau Public.
For the second data set, it is used only for the presentation purposes. These two datasets cannot be merged. This is one of the biggest challeng that I personally faced with. That would be a good idea to detect the quality score and the region of the wine. As a result, two datasets two different projects, but for the project on Tableau it is pretty understandable by the audiance.
# 5. How to USE or Install
The project is straightforward to install, use & modify:

Fork & clone the entire repo on your hard-drive
Download the main dataset https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews and https://www.kaggle.com/rajyellow46/wine-quality

Run the Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) in your preferred Python IDE

Explore the Tableau visuals by visiting the public directory and/or use the provided Tableau .twbx files to play with the visualizations on your own
